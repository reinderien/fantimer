Motivation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This project has been completed to satisfy the continuing professional developme
nt (CPD) requirements to retain CET (Certified Engineering Technologist)
 status with the Ontario Association of Certified Engineering Technicians
 and Technologists (OACETT).
 According to OACETT,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Mandatory CPD will be introduced for most members beginning January 1, 2016.
 [...] The Continuing Professional Development applies to all certified members
 (working full- or part-time), including Life and Fellow OACETT categories.
 Associates admitted to membership prior to July 2005 are required to complete
 continuing professional development as well.

 This project, having taken two weeks of part-time self-directed study and
 falling under the category of

, should satisfy these requirements.

 safety; and detailed analysis of optoisolation technologies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The device being designed is a timed switch.
 It is intended for residential installation to control a fan in a washroom.
 It is designed to retrofit an existing light switch, to be installed behind
 drywall in the same electrical box (or an adjacent electrical box, depending
 on available space).
 When the light switch turns on, the timer turns on the fan; when the light
 switch turns off, the timer continues to run the fan for an additional
 amount of time configurable by an on-board potentiometer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The timer is intended to be simple, safe, and low-cost.
 It does not have any user-accessible controls once the box has been closed.
 Potential applications include a rental property where the owner needs
 some assurance that the fan will reduce mould risk in an environment prone
 to humidity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To simplify prototyping, all parts chosen are through-hole, to be soldered
 to a through-hole perforated prototype board (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

perfboard
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 This eliminates the need for a custom printed circuit board (PCB).
 Hand soldering is feasible due to the low number of component connections.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To again simplify prototyping, Digi-Key® is used as the sole vendor for
 parts, for several reasons: they have a huge variety of products, a fast
 shipping service 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

literal "false"

\end_inset

, and a fairly good search interface.
 Some standard criteria are used to select parts that will be inexpensive,
 readily available, and useful for this project:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Sort ascending by unit price, to choose the least expensive part that still
 meets criteria

\begin_layout Standard
If this product were to be converted to mass manufacturing, it may be more
 cost-effective to move to a different vendor, but that is not currently
 a factor.

\begin_layout Section
Safety Considerations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As in all electrical design, safety must be the top priority.
 Safety applies both to the technologist assembling and testing the circuit,
 as well as the end user.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Lab Safety
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When testing and installing circuits that operate at 120V, the following
 precautions must be observed:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The lab must have a working breaker or fuse.
 If possible, power the circuit through a ground-fault circuit interrupter
 (GFCI).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Have a local switch to disable mains power to the circuit during wiring
 work.
 Never rewire or otherwise touch the circuit unless the mains are de-energized.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Keep a clean and uncluttered workspace.
 Only have on hand the tools and parts needed.
 Remove any unneeded conductors that could cause unintentional shorts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The work surface must be non-conductive.
 Ideally, an electrostatic dissipation (ESD) mat with a grounding line should
 be used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Do not wear any metal jewellery, watches, or accessories that might cause
 unintentional shorts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Before energizing any high-voltage circuits, always do a cursory inspection
 of the circuit to check for faults.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When using testing equipment (e.g.
 multimeter, oscilloscope), take care to select an appropriate range setting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Always have at least one other person on the premises in case of emergency.
 At least one person on the premises must have first-aid training.

\begin_layout Standard
Detection of the light switch status should be done with a circuit isolated
 from mains voltage; a simple and safe option is an optoisolator (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "subsec:opto-input"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 The board power supply and the output switch should also be isolated from
 mains voltage (sections 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted

plural "true"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The enclosure is not described in this document, but should either be metal
 with a connection to earth ground, or plastic (typically ABS).
 The perfboard has mounting holes on its corners.
 A bolt should run through each hole and through plastic stand-off sleeves
 to prevent contact between the circuit and the enclosure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When running wire between solder pads, only strip the necessary amount of
 insulator from the wire ends and no more.
 Trim excess component leads after soldering.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Exterior connections to the board use a terminal block with a compression
 screw, leaf spring and wire guard, for a secure and shielded connection.
 During installation, mains wires that are stripped should have insulator
 running right to the edge of the terminal block aperture so that any exposed
 copper is shielded by the terminal block.
 Any exterior connections to live mains lines should have fuses.
 The terminal block and adjoining fuses are described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "subsec:mains-conn"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The circuit should have some safety against surges.
 The board power supply has built-in surge protection.
 The optoisolator is preceded by a bidirectional-channel transient voltage
 suppression (TVS) diode and surge absorption resistors, described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "subsec:opto-input"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The relay output is protected by a metal-oxide varistor (MOV) and not a
 TVS; this is described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "subsec:fan-output"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whenever switching mains voltage (in this case, for the fan), always switch
 the live line, not the neutral line.
 The neutral line is bonded to earth ground upstream, so neutral voltage
 is close to earth voltage and is safer to use as a common/return than live.
 This strategy is used in

The project files are tracked by a version control system (VCS) called Git.
 Git is best-suited to saving a detailed history of textual files and their
 changes over time.
 As such, all of the files are saved in text format, including the bill
 of materials (BOM) spreadsheet.
 The BOM is saved as a Flat Open Document Format Spreadsheet (FODS) from
 LibreOffice, and is reproduced in appendix

Third-Party Hardware
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The digital storage oscilloscope (DSO) used is a low-cost open-source DS203
 from MiniDSO.
 Given the low bandwidth requirements and low complexity of this project,
 it is adequate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The PIC programmer used is a Microchip PICkit™ 3.
 It is used for in-circuit serial programming (ICSP) of the firmware, and
 although it supports in-circuit debugging (ICD), this is not feasible given
 the low pin count of the PIC.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Custom Software
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To help explore options for component selection, particularly for the passives
 before the optoisolator, a small tool has been written in Python.
 It iterates through possibilities for some resistors, capacitors and TVS
 breakdown voltages, constraining the resistors and capacitors to common
 values in the E24 and E12 series, respectively.

).
 Since nearly all perfboards have a standard 100mil pitch, the most convenient
 block pitch to use is 200mil, which allows for a good balance between expense
 and wire size support.
 The part used actually has a pitch of 5mm, which is very close to 200mil:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(5\textrm{mm}\right)\frac{100\textrm{mil}}{2.54\textrm{mm}}=196.85\textrm{mil}\approx200\textrm{mil}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The terminal block leads are 1mm wide, which requires that the perfboard
 holes be slightly drilled out for this part.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The circuit requiring the highest current-carrying capacity is through the
 terminal block, between AC/L and LIVE_FAN.
 Most ceiling fans typically consume less than 100W, which implies current
 up to 100W/120V = 833mA.
 The Würth 1377 series can carry 16A, and supports the connection style
 described in

\begin_layout Standard
For AC/L, PTC fuses were considered, but for the current ranges needed,
 there is not a good selection, and the components are bulky, expensive
 and slow to trip.
 A filament fuse is used instead (F1 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:schematic"
plural "false"

\end_inset

).
 The standard fuse form factor chosen is 5mm diameter by 20mm length, and
 the manufacturer chosen is Bel Fuse Inc.; they carry fast-response filament
 fuses over a wide current rating range.
 The fuse is held with two 5mm clips.
 Although the fan is not expected to draw over 833mA steady-state, motors
 typically have a surge current many times above that.
 For this reason, the chosen fuse is rated for 5A, and will trip in 1s with
 a current of about 9.5A (

 This is low enough to be compatible with microcontrollers in the Microchip
 PIC® series, but high enough to directly drive a relay coil.
 The simplest - though not necessarily the most cost-effective, nor physically
 smallest - style of supply is an integrated, enclosed unit such as the
 MeanWell IRM-01-5.

Line Detection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The analog section requiring the most detailed analysis is the line detection
 circuit.
 This circuit is designed not to directly measure the amount of voltage
 on the line, but simply to indicate to the timing microcontroller whether
 the light switch is on or not.
 As such, it has no linearity requirements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The central component in the line detection circuit is the optoisolator.
 The only requirements are that the input be a pair of antiparallel LEDs
 for AC support, plus the vendor criteria (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The input is 120Vac (170Vpk), but the forward voltage drop of the opto is
 only ~1.1V.
 During steady-state operation of the circuit, the majority of this voltage
 difference should be dropped by capacitance rather than resistance, to
 decrease power and heat output.
 The circuit should also include a TVS.
 Both the TVS and the opto should be preceded by an absorption impedance
 should there be an over-voltage event, but this impedance cannot be purely
 capacitive, as that would be invisible to transients; so there should be
 some minimum resistance.
 The resistance must also account for the worst-case input surge event,
 where the switch is closed at input cycle peak and the capacitors are uncharged.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For simplicity's sake – and to take advantage of economies of scale, should
 this be mass-manufactured – make the absorption resistors R1 and R2 equal
 to each other, and the voltage drop capacitors C1 and C2 also equal to
 each other.
 The TVS diode must then have a minimum breakdown voltage equal to the midpoint
 between the input and opto peak voltages, or

F2 is a CPTC.
 Polymeric and ceramic fuses open the circuit during thermal overload from

Optoisolator Output
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The output of the optoisolator is an optical-base transistor, in this circuit
 configured for common emitter mode.
 High collector current severely impedes the performance of the transistor
 and increases saturation voltage, so it should be kept as low as possible.
 Rather than using a discrete resistor for load, the load can be the weak
 pull-up (WPU) resistance of a port on the PIC.
 With 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{DD}=5\textrm{V}$
\end_inset

 and T=25°C this is typically 22k (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, p.
 56).
 Due to the way that the opto is biased, the transistor is nearly always
 in saturation except when the input crosses zero, going below the opto
 forward voltage drop: 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|V_{in}\right|<V_{f}$
\end_inset

 .
 During this crossing, the output will briefly exit saturation and be pulled
 up.
 On every quarter-cycle of the input (every half-cycle of the output), the
 off time is expected to be
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
t_{off}=\frac{1}{2\pi\cdot60\textrm{Hz}}\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{1.1\textrm{V}}{120\sqrt{2}}\right)=17.2\mu s
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This indicates a pulse width of about 34.4us on every cycle of the output,
 assuming ideal operation of the opto.
 In practice, the pulse is wider.
 To maintain a consistent logic level, the pulse peak cannot exceed the
 input-high level for the port,

 (

, p.

 Raising the capacitance across the output lowers the peak.
 The capacitor should be chosen to be high enough such that the input never
 exceeds 2V minus a safe margin, but low enough that the output still responds
 quickly when the voltage from the mains input is interrupted.
 When C3 is set to 100nF, the PIC WPU is enabled and the switch is energized,
 the zero-crossing peak reaches ~500mV (

Fan Output
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\begin_layout Standard
The fan is energized by the following sequence of events.
 The PIC uses the tristate (TRIS) bit corresponding to general purpose I/O
 port 2 (GP2) to control whether the pin is in input or output mode.
 In the brief time during initialization where TRIS is not yet low and the
 port is in high-impedance mode, R4 acts as a weak pulldown and disables
 the fan by default.
 Once initialization is complete, TRIS for GP2 is kept low and the port
 is kept in the output state.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the PIC timing logic needs to activate the fan, it sets GP2 high (5V).
 This activates Q1.
 Q1 is a general-purpose MOSFET from Supertex Inc.

).
 It is configured in common-source and used to drive the relay coil.
 Due to inductive effects and current higher than that tolerable by the
 PIC output port (71mA), the coil should not be driven by the PIC directly,
 but Q1 can tolerate up to 200mA 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Q1 turns on, pulling down its drain and activating the relay coil.
 The relay closes, and current runs between AC/L and LIVE_FAN.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the PIC timing logic needs to deactivate the fan, it sets GP2 low,
 which turns off Q1, opening its drain.
 The coil voltage will spike when the relay opens, but will be limited by
 the Schottky diode D1 entering forward bias.
 Since the fan motor is expected to be an inductive load, it may similarly
 spike, but will be limited by the MOV R5.
 A MOV is used due to the absence of absorption resistors and the failure
 mode characteristics of a TVS.
 MOVs have a negative temperature coefficient (NTC), meaning that as they
 heat up in an over-voltage event, their resistance decreases, increasing
 current on the circuit and allowing the circuit breaker to trip or fuse
 to blow; a TVS would fail before the circuit breaker or fuse could act.

Board
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The perfboard, being manually soldered, does not have traces or vias.
 However, care must still be taken in placement, to reduce the length of
 wiring needed, and to physically separate high-voltage regions from low-voltage
 regions.

) - The yellow lines between pins indicate wire that needs to be run.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Dimension - the golden rectangle shows the edge of the board.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
tPlace and tDocu (grey) - component shapes.
 Some of these are approximations due to exact libraries being unavailable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
tNames (grey) - component names.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
tValues (grey) - component values.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
tKeepout (red stipple) - these regions indicate where there are no holes
 in the perfboard; component pins cannot be placed here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
vRestrict (green dash) - this illustrates the division between high voltage
 (left) isolated from low voltage (right).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Drills (grey) - illustrates where holes for component pins must be.
 Pads are not shown.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Holes (grey) - the holes in each corner of the board for mounting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Measures (grey) - the dimensions shown around the sides of the board.
 The board is 58x78mm edge to edge, but the usable pin area is 2100x2500mil.
 This is in mil because of the 100mil perforation pitch.

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This has been a good opportunity to stay up-to-date on domain knowledge
 and skills, and to research some areas of the field that are not covered
 in detail in school.
 The design concept is sound, and the device is functional after having
 been implemented.
 Future work could include:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Replacing the enclosed power supply with a custom, discrete-component-based
 power supply to reduce cost
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Implementing a custom enclosure, potentially using 3D CAD and 3D printing
 technology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Scaling the design up to be able to accommodate 240Vac or multi-phase input
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Scaling the design down physically, to use surface-mounted devices (SMD)
 reducing cost and space requirements
